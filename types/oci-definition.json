oci
------------
``oci`` for all artifacts stored in registries that conform to the
`OCI Distribution Specification <https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec>`_,
including container images built by Docker and others:

- There is no canonical package repository for OCI artifacts. Therefore
  ``oci`` purls must be registry agnostic by default. To specify the repository,
  provide a ``repository_url`` value.
- OCI purls do not contain a ``namespace``, although, ``repository_url`` may
  contain a namespace as part of the physical location of the package.
- The ``name`` is not case sensitive and must be lowercased. The name is the
  last fragment of the repository name. For example if the repository
  name is ``library/debian`` then the ``name`` is ``debian``.
- The ``version`` is the ``sha256:hex_encoded_lowercase_digest`` of the
  artifact and is required to uniquely identify the artifact.
- Optional qualifiers may include:

  - ``arch``: key for a package architecture, when relevant.
  - ``repository_url``: A repository URL where the artifact may be found, but not
    intended as the only location. This value is encouraged to identify a
    location the content may be fetched.
  - ``tag``: artifact tag that may have been associated with the digest at the time.
- Examples::

      pkg:oci/debian@sha256%3A244fd47e07d10?repository_url=docker.io/library/debian&arch=amd64&tag=latest
      pkg:oci/debian@sha256%3A244fd47e07d10?repository_url=ghcr.io/debian&tag=bullseye
      pkg:oci/static@sha256%3A244fd47e07d10?repository_url=gcr.io/distroless/static&tag=latest
      pkg:oci/hello-wasm@sha256%3A244fd47e07d10?tag=v1
