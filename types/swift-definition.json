`swift` for Swift packages:

- There is no default package repository: this should be implied from `namespace`.
- The `namespace` is source host and user/organization and is required.
- The `name` is the repository name.
- The `version` is the package version and is required.
- Examples::

      pkg:swift/github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire@5.4.3
      pkg:swift/github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxFlow@2.12.4
