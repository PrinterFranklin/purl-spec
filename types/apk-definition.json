apk
---
`apk` for APK-based packages:

- There is no default package repository: this should be implied either from
  the `distro` qualifiers key  or using a repository base url as
  `repository_url` qualifiers key.
- The `namespace` is the vendor such as `alpine` or `openwrt`. It is not
  case sensitive and must be lowercased.
- The `name` is the package name. It is not case sensitive and must be
  lowercased.
- The `version` is a package version as expected by apk.
- The `arch` is the qualifiers key for a package architecture.
- Examples::

      pkg:apk/alpine/curl@7.83.0-r0?arch=x86
      pkg:apk/alpine/apk@2.12.9-r3?arch=x86
