composer
--------
``composer`` for Composer PHP packages:

- The default repository is ``https://packagist.org``.
- The ``namespace`` is the vendor.
- The ``namespace`` and ``name`` are not case sensitive and must be lowercased.
- Note: private, local packages may have no name. In this case you cannot
  create a ``purl`` for these.
- Examples::

      pkg:composer/laravel/laravel@5.5.0
