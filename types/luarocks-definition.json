luarocks
--------
``luarocks`` for Lua packages installed with LuaRocks:

- ``namespace``: The user manifest under which the package is registered.
  If not given, the root manifest is assumed.
  It is case insensitive, but lowercase is encouraged since namespaces
  are normalized to ASCII lowercase.
- ``name``: The LuaRocks package name.
  It is case insensitive, but lowercase is encouraged since package names
  are normalized to ASCII lowercase.
- ``version``: The full LuaRocks package version, including module version
  and rockspec revision.
  It is case sensitive, and lowercase must be used to avoid
  compatibility issues with older LuaRocks versions.
  The full version number is required to uniquely identify a version.
- Qualifier ``repository_url``: The LuaRocks rocks server to be used;
  useful in case a private server is used (optional).
  If omitted, ``https://luarocks.org`` as default server is assumed.

Examples::

      pkg:luarocks/luasocket@3.1.0-1
      pkg:luarocks/hisham/luafilesystem@1.8.0-1
      pkg:luarocks/username/packagename@0.1.0-1?repository_url=https://example.com/private_rocks_server/
